# C Mini Projects 

Welcome to this C Mini Projects repository! 
This repo is part of the Devarc initiative by the GITAM GitHub Club and contains simple starter-level **C programs** that contributors can improve and enhance.

Each program is intentionally basic so contributors can rewrite, optimise, or expand features **inside the existing programs**.
